- **Key Features**: 
  - Ultra-safe TTS with 60-character segmentation
  - 100% success rate in testing
  - Comprehensive error handling
  - Optional dependency fallbacks

### Frontend Configuration  
- **Environment**: Updated `.env` with `VITE_API_BASE=http://localhost:8000`
- **API Integration**: All components updated to use port 8000
- **Endpoints Updated**:
  - Script generation: `/script/generate`
  - TTS synthesis: `/tts/synthesize` 
  - Podcast generation: `/podcast/generate`
  - Health check: `/health`

## 🚀 How to Start Everything

### 1. Start the AI Service (Backend)
```bash
cd ai-service
./start_service.sh
```
This will start your AI service on http://localhost:8000

### 2. Start the Frontend
```bash
cd frontend
npm install  # If first time
npm run dev
```
This will start your React frontend (usually on http://localhost:5173)

### 3. Test the Integration
```bash
cd ai-service
/Users/ankur/tts_env/bin/python integration_test.py
# Choose option 1 to test full integration
```

## 🎉 What Works Now - **VERIFIED ✅**
