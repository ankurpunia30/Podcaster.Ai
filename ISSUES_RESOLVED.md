# 🎯 Issue Resolution Complete!

## ✅ Fixed: Library Page White Screen Issue

### Problem
When clicking on "Library" in the UI, the page turned white due to JavaScript errors.

### Root Cause
The LibraryTab component was referencing an undefined variable `filter` instead of the properly defined `filterState.status`.

### Solution Applied
```jsx
// Before (caused error):
value={filter}
onChange={(e) => setFilter(e.target.value)}

// After (fixed):
value={filterState.status}
onChange={(e) => setFilterState(prev => ({ ...prev, status: e.target.value }))}
```

### Result
- ✅ Library page now renders correctly
- ✅ Filter dropdown works properly  
- ✅ No more white screen errors
- ✅ Proper loading states implemented

## ✅ Fixed: TTS Context Understanding Issue

### Problem
The AI-generated content was being read literally by the TTS model, including:
- Stage directions like "[music plays]"
- Speaker labels like "HOST:"
- Formatting like "**bold**" and timestamps
- Technical instructions instead of natural speech

### Solutions Applied

#### 1. Improved Script Generation Prompt
- ❌ Removed all formatting instructions
- ❌ Eliminated stage directions and timestamps  
- ❌ Removed speaker labels and technical notes
- ✅ Focused on natural, conversational speech
- ✅ Direct address to listeners
- ✅ Proper punctuation for natural pauses

#### 2. Added Text Cleaning Function
```python
def clean_text_for_tts(text: str) -> str:
    """Clean text for better TTS pronunciation"""
    # Remove stage directions: [music plays], (pause)
    # Remove speaker labels: HOST:, NARRATOR:
    # Remove timestamps: [00:30], (2:15)  
    # Remove formatting: **bold**, *italic*
    # Expand abbreviations: AI → artificial intelligence
    # Normalize whitespace and punctuation
```

#### 3. Applied Cleaning Before TTS
The text cleaning function is automatically applied before sending text to the TTS model, ensuring:
- Natural pronunciation
- No literal reading of formatting
- Proper abbreviation expansion
- Clean, flowing speech

### Results
- ✅ TTS now speaks naturally instead of reading formatting
- ✅ Stage directions and technical notes are removed
- ✅ Abbreviations are expanded for better pronunciation  
- ✅ More conversational and engaging audio output
- ✅ Proper sentence flow and pauses
